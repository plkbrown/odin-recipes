        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Picture this...it's Friday night and your three best friends drop by unannounced for an impromptu girl's night. Your first thought is probably, "This is going to be great!" But your next thought is surely, "Oh no! What am I going to serve them?!" I was in this exact situation when BAM! The thought hit me. I had all the ingredients to make a simple, but incredibly tasty, hot spinach dip. Guaranteed to be a crowd pleaser, of course!</p>

        <p>Creamy, cheesy, contains vegetables, and you get to dip bread or crackers? Say no more! Here are some secrets to this recipe's success. First, make sure you squeeze as much water out of your spinach as possible. You can do this with your hands, a potato ricer, or squeeze the spinach between a few layers of paper towels. Second, I recommend using fresh spinach for a brighter flavor, but you can use frozen in a pinch. Third, try to use at least 2 different types of cheese to increase the depth of flavor. Finally, you can make it up to 8 hours ahead - just store it in the fridge until you're ready to bake it!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 oz cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup sour cream</li>

            <li>3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped</li>
            <li>bread, crackers, and/or vegetables for serving</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
