        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>As a busy young adult with a full time job, sometimes I can't even fathom coming home and cooking a full meal at the end of the day. It's often around 5 o'clock in the afternoon when the craving for take-out starts to hit, but I know that I deserve a yummy <em>and</em> nutritional meal at the end of a long day. This is where my favorite kitchen gadget comes to the rescue - my slow cooker! By setting this baby to cook on low in the morning, I can come home after work knowing that I have a good meal waiting for me. But the slow cooker doesn't stop there! You can also set it on high after work, and have a low effort dinner ready in just 2 hours.I probably make this slow cooker honey garlic chicken at least once a month. It's constantly in my rotation, it's that good! All it takes is just a few pantry staples, some chicken breast, and boom! Perfection.</p>
