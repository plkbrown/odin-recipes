        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Growing up, some families had "Taco Tuesday," "Pizza Friday," or even "Pancake Saturday." In my family, we had "Chinese Take-Out Sunday." This was a cherished tradition in my childhood home because it brought the whole family together to start the week on a positive note. We would gather around the table, talk about the weekend, and yeah- there was always some grumbling about the coming week...but gathered around our kitchen table, nothing could bother us for long. Every Sunday, my mom ordered the same thing. Some version of Fried Rice, Crab Rangoon, a main dish with chicken for my brother, and <em>always</em> Beef and Broccoli for me.</p>

        <p>As a grown lady on a budget, getting take-out every Sunday is not very realistic, but I always crave that comfort of our old family dinners. So I thought, "What's stopping me from making it for myself?" Ding-ding! Which brings us to this recipe. This home-made beef and broccoli is full of protein, vegetables, and the most addictive sauce you can imagine. Plus the best part is, it comes together in only 5 easy steps!</p>

       <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/3 cup oyster sauce</li>
            <li>1/3 cup sherry <em>(may substitute apple cider vinegar)</em></li>
            <li>2 tsp sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp soy sauce <em>(may substitute low sodium soy sauce)</em></li>
            <li>1 tsp sweetener of your choice <em>(i.e sugar, honey, stevia, etc)</em></li>
            <li>1 tsp cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 lb flank steak</li>
            <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 thin slice of fresh ginger root <em>(optional)</em></li>
            <li>3 cloves of garlic, peeled and smashed</li>
            <li>1 lb broccoli florets</li></ul>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine the oyster sauce, sherry, sesame oil, soy sauce, sweetener, and cornstarch.</li>
            <li>Cut steak into 1/2 in strips and place in a bowl. Pour the sauce mixture from step 1 over the steak and marinate in the fridge for at least 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the steak marinates, heat 1 tbsp of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add in garlic and ginger, saute until fragrant. Once the garlic and ginger are fragrant, stir in the broccoli florets. Cook until the broccoli is bright green and almost tender, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove broccoli from skillet and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining 2 tbsp of olive oil to the skillet. When oil is heated, add the marinate and steak to the skillet. Cook until sauce thickens and meat is no longer pink, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>When the steak is cooked, add the broccoli back to the skillet and stir to combine and heated through, about 3 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
